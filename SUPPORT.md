# Support Policy

- **Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)**: 1.85.0 (released 2025-02-20) because the crate opts into the Rust 2024 edition. Builds on older compilers are not guaranteed.
- **Issue triage**: New issues are labeled within 3 business days. Critical data-loss bugs (e.g., incorrect symlink replacement) receive a response within 24 hours.
- **Release cadence**: Aim for a patch release whenever we accumulate 2+ fixes or a security issue is discovered. Expect at least one release per quarter while the project is active (and there are reasonable enhancements to be made).
- **Platform matrix**: Continuous integration covers Linux, macOS, and Windows. Other Unix platforms are supported on a best-effort basis.
- **Communication channels**: GitHub Discussions for questions; GitHub Issues for bugs/feature requests.

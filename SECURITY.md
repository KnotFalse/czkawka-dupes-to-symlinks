- Please include `czkawka-dupes-to-symlinks` version, platform, reproduction steps, and whether any sensitive data might have leaked.
- We strive to acknowledge reports within 24 hours and provide a remediation plan within 72 hours.
- Security advisories are disclosed publicly after a fix or mitigation is available (or within 30 days, whichever comes first).
